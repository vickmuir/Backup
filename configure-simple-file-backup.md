## Configuring a backup job

Through the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal, you can manage and monitor your backups. You can choose between manual or automatic backup agent configuration methods.

  - The automatic agent configuration creates a backup job of the complete C Drive (Windows OS) or ./ <root> directory (Linux OS) with Monthly and Daily Retention schemes.

    This job can be modified after it was configured.
    {:note}

    1. Create a password.
    2. Confirm the password.
    3. Add a password hint.
    4. Click **Configure automatically**.

  - If you choose to configure the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} agent manually, the automatic settings are ignored and you can specify the folders and files to be retained with a retention scheme of your choice.

    1. In the navigation, click **Computers**, then the expansion arrow to display the information of the selected server.
    2. Click **Configure Manually**. This loads the vault settings page.
    3. Click **Add Vault**.
    4. Expand the Vault Profile menu and select the vault. All values auto-populate.
    5. Click **Save**.
    6. Click the **Jobs** tab.
    7. From the Select Job Task menu, select **Create New Local System Job**.
    8. In the Create New Job window, enter a Job Name and a Job Description.
    9. Select the files and folders you want to include in the backup.
    10. Enter the encyption password into the Password and Confirm Password fields. You can also add a Password Hint.

      You need this password to restore files from the backup. Without the password, you can't restore an encrypted backup and there's no way to recover a lost password.
      {:important}
    11. Click **Apply now** to confirm the backup sets before creating the job.
    12. You can leave the Advanced Backup Options with their default settings. If you want detailed log files for the backup job, you can enable them by expanding the *Log Detail Level* menu and selecting **File**.
    13. Click **Create Job**. The View/Add Schedule window is loaded.
    14. {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} offers 3 job retention schemes: Daily , Weekly , Monthly. Select the appropriate retention period and click **Save**.

    Multiple retention schedules can be setup for same job but it’s important they are NOT be run at same time. For more information about Retention Schemes, see the [FAQ](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-faqs#faqs).
