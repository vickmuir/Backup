# Canceling an {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} service

You can cancel your {{site.data.keyword.backup_full}} service at any time. The cancellation deletes your vault with the backed-up data and you can't log in to {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal with the canceled {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} credentials.

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){:new_window} and click the **menu** icon on the upper left. Select **Classic Infrastructure**.<br/>
   Alternatively, you can log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.
2. Click **Storage** > **Backup** to display the servers with backup service.
3. Select **Actions** > **Cancel {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}}**.
4. Choose to cancel **Immediately** or on the **Anniversary Date**.

   You can cancel the service anytime. However, when a backup vault is deleted before the end of the monthly billing cycle, you do not receive a refund.

5. Select **Continue**.
6. Check that **I acknowledge that due to cancellation data loss may occur**. Then, select **Cancel {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}}**.
