# Canceling an {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} service
{: #cancelBackup}

You can cancel your {{site.data.keyword.backup_full}} service at any time. The cancellation deletes your vault with the backed-up data and you can't log in to Cloud Backup Portal with the canceled credentials.
{:shortdesc}

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}){: external}. From the Navigational Menu, select **Classic Infrastructure**.
2. Click **Storage** > **Cloud Backup** to display the servers with backup service.
3. Select **Actions** > **Cancel {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}}**.
4. Choose to cancel **Immediately** or on the **Anniversary Date**.

   You can cancel the service anytime. However, when a backup vault is deleted before the end of the monthly billing cycle, you do not receive a refund.
   {:important}
5. Select **Continue**.
6. Check that **I acknowledge that due to cancellation data loss may occur**. Then, select **Cancel {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}}**.
